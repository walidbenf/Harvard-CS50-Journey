# Understanding Base Systems with Fingers

## Unary Counting with Raised Fingers

When counting up to 5 by only using raised fingers, this is a form of unary (base-1) counting. Here's how it works:

### Unary System (Base 1)

- **Definition**: The unary system is a numeral system where quantities are represented by repeating a single symbol. For example, to represent the number 3, you would use three identical symbols, like III.
- **Application to Raised Fingers**: Each raised finger represents one unit. Counting by adding one raised finger for each additional unit is similar to unary counting. Each raised finger is a symbol representing a single unit.

### Practical Example

- **Number of Raised Fingers with One Hand**:
  - 1 raised finger = 1 (in unary system)
  - 2 raised fingers = 2 (in unary system)
  - 3 raised fingers = 3 (in unary system)
  - 4 raised fingers = 4 (in unary system)
  - 5 raised fingers = 5 (in unary system)

In unary counting, the total number is simply the sum of identical symbols (raised fingers in this case). Each finger represents one unit, and the total number is the count of these symbols.

### Conclusion

Counting with raised fingers to represent quantities follows the unary system principle, as each raised finger represents a distinct unit, and the total quantity is the sum of these units.

## Binary Counting with Fingers

When using a hand to count in binary, where each finger can be either raised (1) or not raised (0), you represent numbers in binary format. For a hand with 5 fingers, each finger represents a bit.

### Calculation

Each finger has 2 possible states (raised or not raised). With 5 fingers, the number of possible combinations is:

\[ 2^n \]

where \( n \) is the number of fingers. 

So, with 5 fingers:

\[ 2^5 = 32 \]

### Counting in Binary with One Hand

- **Binary Representation**: Each finger can be either 0 or 1. You can represent numbers from 0 to 31 in binary using 5 bits.
- **Range**:
  - **0**: All fingers are down.
  - **1**: Only the first finger is up (binary 00001).
  - **2**: Only the second finger is up (binary 00010).
  - **3**: The first and second fingers are up (binary 00011).
  - **31**: All fingers are up (binary 11111).

### Conclusion

Using a hand to count in binary allows for representing numbers from 0 to 31, showing how binary systems work with multiple states per bit. Computers also use binary, but with many more "bits" (or "fingers"), allowing for a vast number of combinations.
